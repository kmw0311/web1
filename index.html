      Hong Kong has been gripped by political unrest since early June, following the attempted introduction of the now-shelved extradition bill.
Protesters had demanded that the bill -- which many feared could be used to spirit critics of Beijing across the border to be tried under China's legal system -- be permanently withdrawn.
Lam submitted a report to China that assessed the protesters’ primary demands and found that withdrawing the bill could help to resolve the crisis, according to the report.
Beijing dismissed Lam’s suggestion and ordered her not to accede to any of the protesters’ other key demands at the time, the report said, citing three individuals with direct knowledge of the matter.
According to Reuters, Lam’s report was made in advance of meeting in the Chinese city of Shenzhen on August 7 with senior mainland officials, almost two months after the protest movement began.
In addition to the full withdrawal of the bill, other protest demands outlined in Lam’s report included an independent inquiry into the protests, fully democratic elections, the removal of the term “riot” in describing protests, and scrapping all charges against those arrested so far.
